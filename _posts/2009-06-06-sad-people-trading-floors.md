# Sad People on Trading Floors

<p>It seems that I&nbsp;am not the only one who is starting to believe that the media is overplaying a bit the theme of stocks &quot;diving&quot;, &quot;plunging&quot;&nbsp;and / or &quot;plummetting&quot;. Thankfully, besides colorful language, they also have the handy &quot;Sad guy on trading floor picture&quot;.</p><p>Some blogs have taken the trouble to put these &quot;sad guy&quot; photos all together and the result is definitely funny. See for yourself <a href="http://sadguysontradingfloors.tumblr.com/">here</a>, <a href="http://richard-wilson.blogspot.com/2008/10/trading-floor-shots-top-10-pictures.html">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/9961">here</a>.</p><p>My favourite:</p><p><img src="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/08/sad_guys_3.png" alt="" /></p><p>I am not ignoring the potential for human tragedy that these troubled times for stock exchange have, but I do believe that overdoing and overplaying fears and uncertaintities by the media is definitely not helping.</p>
