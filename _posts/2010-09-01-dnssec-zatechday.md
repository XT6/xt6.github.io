# 2010-11: Introduction to DNSSEC

<p>Together with Nicol&aacute;s Antoniello we presented a series of two talks introducing DNSSEC to a wide audience of system administrators and other IT&nbsp;professionals.</p>
<p>One of these talks was presented at <a href="http://www.zonamerica.com/techday/home.aspx">Zonamerica TechDay</a>, a large IT event that took place in Montevideo in September 2010.</p>

  Here are the slides (Spanish only for now)
